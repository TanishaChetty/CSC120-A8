- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


For the library, I decided to overload the constructor in order to be able to add things to the map when you only know the address. I also overloaded the constructor for Cafe and House for the same reason. For library, I also decided to overload the checkOut method so people can check out TWO books at a time. For house, I decided to overload the moveIn method so if two people are moving into the house as roommates, they can be added at the same time. For cafe, I decided to overload the sellCoffee constructor so if someone wants their coffee black, they just have to specify the size. Honestly, this assignment wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Yay!
